# RECIPE BOOK

A super minimal recipe website. Create a new recipe as a markdown file, dump it in a folder and upload. The list will auto-populate and each recipe is displayed in a nice, clean format designed for use while cooking or at the grocery store. Great for keeping track of family recipes, mods to ones you find online, or have created yourself!

Each recipe will auto-generate links to a Google image search for that dish, recipes on Serious Eats and Google, and for restaurants on Yelp (in case you burn something and need takeout fast).

## BONUS!  
To save your place while looking up at the ingredients, click the step you're on to highlight it. Click it again to remove the highlight, or use the left/right arrow keys to advance.

## RECIPE FORMAT  
In order to show up properly, your recipe's Markdown file should be named with dashes in place of spaces (ex: `rice-pilaf.md` or `saag-paneer.md`) and the file should follow this format:
