## steps

### make toasted rice powder:  
1. heat wok or skillet over high heat  
2. add raw rice and cook until rice is toasted and dark brown (3-5 mins)  
3. remove from wok and cool, grind into a coarse powder in a mortar or food processor  

### make the galangal paste:  
1. in a dry cast iron skillet, roast the garlic, galangal, and shallots until fragrant and soft  
2. (galangal should look dry  on both sides but don't let it burn, should take about 5 minutes)  
3. pound in a mortar and pestle (or grind in a food processor) until a smooth, "lightly fibrous" paste forms  

### make salad:  
1. heat wok or skillet over high heat, pour in oil  
2. add chicken and 1 tbsp galangal paste, stirring constantly    
3. cook until nearly cooked through (not about browning just getting cooked)  
4. add fish sauce mixture, stir and cook 2-3 minutes until most of the liquid is absorbed  
5. remove from heat and let sit until the chicken is warm but not hot  
6. add shallots, lemongrass, 1 tbsp rice powder, lime leaf, and the herbs (reserving a bit for garnish)  
7. plate and sprinkle a bit of the herbs and a generous pinch of rice powder  

### serve:  
1. spoon onto service plate and surround with cucumber, chiles, and lettuce (if using)
