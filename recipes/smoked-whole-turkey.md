# Smoked Whole Turkey  

## info  
* 24 hours for the dry brine, then 4–5 hours total to cook  
* Enough for four plus some leftovers    

## ingredients  
* Whole turkey (10–14 pounds, spatchcocked)  
* Kosher salt (1/2 tsp per pound)  
* Ground black pepper  
* Olive oil  

## steps

### The day before

1. The day before cooking the turkey, spatchcock the bird, rinse with water, and dry thoroughly with paper towels  
2. Rub with kosher salt across entire surface of the bird  
3. Place on a wire-rimmed baking sheet and let sit in the fridge, uncovered, for approximately 24 hours to dry brine  

### The day of (approximately 4 hours before eating)

1. Light a chimney with charcoal, place on one side for indirect heat  
2. Add a water pan on the other side  
3. Add hardwood chunks to coals (apple is a nice choice)  
4. Let smoker come up to temp, approximately 325–350ºF  
5. Meanwhile, rub the turkey with black pepper (shouldn't need additional salt after the brining)  
6. Place the turkey on the smoker, breast up and legs facing the fire  
7. Add additional water to the pan and charcoal as necessary but don't add more hardwood (smoke flavor may overwhelm the turkey); if the legs or wings start to get too dark, wrap with aluminum foil  
8. Let turkey cook until the internal temperature in the deepest part of the breast is 160ºF, approximately 2–3 hours  
9. Take off the smoker and let sit for one hour uncovered  
10. Carve and serve!  

## notes  
* Could definitely use a BBQ rub instead of just black pepper, but be sure to cut the amount of salt you use!
