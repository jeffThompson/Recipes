# Chicken Schnitzel

## info  
* About 1.5 hours  
* Hearty meal for 2 plus enough for sandwiches the next day

## ingredients
* 2 quarts water  
* 1/3 cup kosher salt  
* 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts  
* 2/4 cup all-purpose flour  
* 2 large eggs, beaten  
* 2 cups panko bread crumbs  
* Peanut, canola, or other neutral oil  

## steps  
1. Cut tenders from chicken breasts, if present  
2. Whisk water and salt in a large bowl or tray, add chicken and brine in the fridge for 30 minutes  
3. Remove chicken, pat dry, and butterfly as needed into pieces about 1/4" thick  
4. Place chicken in a plastic bag, one piece at a time, and pound with a rolling pin or meat tenderizer until thin and even  
5. Place flour, eggs, and panko onto separate plates (pie tins work great for this)  
6. Heat oil in a cast iron skillet to 375º F  
7. Batter chicken one piece at a time in the flour, egg, and panko, patting lightly to get a thorough coating  
8. Keep prepped cutlets on wire rack  
9. Fry cutlets, a few at a time and turning often, until golden brown and crisp, about 3–4 minutes total  
10. Remove to a wire rack, adding salt immediately  
11. Serve with lemon slices, coleslaw, and cold beer  

## notes    
* These are *really* good on bao with some Bonchon-style hot sauce!
* Consider adding this to the flour: 2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 cup gochugaru (Korean red chlii flakes), 1 tbsp black pepper, 2 tbsp garlic powder, 1.5 tsp kosher salt  
* You can also change up the brine: 1/2 cup kimchi juice, 1 cup buttermilk, 1 egg, 1.5 tsp kosher salt, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1/4 cup gochugaru, 2 tbsp black pepper  
* Can use half butter, half oil to fry
