## steps
1. Preheat the oven to 275º F

cook the pork:  
1. Cut the pork into 2-inch cubes, add to roasting pan and season with 1 tbsp salt  
2. Squeeze the orange juice over the pork and add quarters to pan  
3. Add 2 onion quarters, 4 garlic cloves, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick  
4. Pour oil over the surface and cover tightly with aluminum foil  
5. Cook until pork is fork tender, about 3.5 hours  
6. When done, discard the orange, onion, garlic, cinnamon, and bay leaves  
7. Transfer pork and liquid to a strainer and let drain for 10 mins  
8. Put pork back in roasting pan  
9. Skim fat from the surface of the strained liquid and add back to pork (can add a little of the pork liquid too, but not too much – add some oil if there's not enough fat)  
10. Shred into large chunks with two forks and season to taste with salt  

make the salsa:  
1. Transfer remaining liquid to medium saucepot  
2. Add tomatillos, 2 onion quarters, 2 garlic cloves, and jalepenos  
3. Add water until it is about 1-inch below top of vegetables  
4. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook until all vegetables are completely tender (about 10 mins)  
5. Blend with hand-blender until smooth, season to taste with salt  

cook the pork (again):  
1. Place roasting pan, foil removed, about 4-inches under high broiler  
2. Cook until brown and cristp, stir and repeat several more times  

to serve:  
1. Combine the finely-chopped onion and cilantro in a bowl  
2. Serve with lime wedges and crumbled queso fresco  

## notes  
* Rick at Bon Appetit suggests adding 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar (or other acid) at the end to "wake up" the flavors
