# Bagels

## info  
* 1.5 hours, 12–24 hours proof, then about 45 minutes  
* 6 bagels, or 8 small-ish ones  

## ingredients
* 14.66 oz bread flour (APF ok but not as good)  
* 4 tsp vital wheat gluten (optional, sub with more flour)  
* 2 tsp instant yeast  
* 9 oz cold water  
* 1–2 tbsp malt syrup (or honey)  
* 2 tsp salt  
* Cornmeal  
* 1/4 cup baking soda  
* Olive oil  

## steps  
1. In a food processor, combine flour, wheat gluten, and yeast; pulse to combine  
2. Add water and malt syrup, mix for 20 seconds  
3. Let dough sit for 20 minutes  
4. Add salt, run food processor for 90 seconds  
5. Remove dough and knead for about a minute  
6. Divide into eight balls (for small-ish bagels) or 6 (for normal ones)  
7. Roll into round balls (do not flatten), cover, and let sit for 15 minutes  
8. Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil, then thoroughly dust with cornmeal  
9. Place dough ball on work surface; poke hole with finger, then work into an even, bagel-like shape (hole should be slightly larger than you think it should be but don't make the bagels too thin!) and place on baking sheet  
10. Cover and let sit for an hour, then transfer to fridge for 12–24 hours (see note)  

Cook the bagels  
1. Bring a pot of water to a full boil, add baking soda  
2. Meanwhile, preheat the oven, with a pizza stone inside, to 450ºF  
3. Fill a small plate with any toppings you'll be using in a thick layer  
4. Cut a piece of parchment paper for each bagel and place on a pizza peel  
5. One at a time, drop the bagel into the water (cornmeal side up) and cook for 30 seconds; flip and cook for another 30 seconds (see note)  
6. Remove and place face down in the plate of toppings, if using, then put face up on a piece of parchment paper; repeat with remaining bagels  
6. Bake for about 17 minutes, then flip and cook for another 5 minutes to ensure the bottoms are crisp  
7. Remove to a wire rack and let rest for at least 15 minutes before eating  

## notes  
* Proofing times vary by recipe: some say up to 40 hours is probably ok though I found that I can't really tell the difference when proofing longer than 12 hours  
* While some recipes call for sugar or malt syrup in the boiling water, I find it's overly-sweet  
* The longer you boil the bagels, the more chewy they will become but you risk deflation. I find 30–40 seconds is what I like, but you can experiment here! 60 seconds per side is probably the max  
* See some of the troubleshooting links below for info on what you can tweak in the recipe and the effects those changes will have
