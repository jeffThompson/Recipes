# Mac and Cheese

## ingredients
* 2.5 cups milk (low-fat ok)  
* 2 bay leaves  
* 1 lb elbow, shell, ziti, or similar pasta  
* 4 tbsp (1/2 stick) butter  
* 2 shallots (or 1/2 yellow onion), finely chopped  
* 2-3 cloves garlic, finely chopped  
* 3 tbsp all-purpose flour  
* 1.5 cups grated sharp cheddar or gouda  
* 1.5 cups grated Parmesan cheese  
* 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs  
* Freshly-ground black pepper  
* Salt to taste

## steps
1. Preheat the oven to 400º F, bring a large pot of salted water to boil  
2. Grease a roasting pan with 1 tbsp butter  
3. In a frying pan, fry the shallots and garlic until golden brown  
3. Cook the milk with bay leaves in a small saucepan over medium-low heat  
4. When small bubbles appear along the sides (about 5 mins) turn off the heat, add the cooked shallots and garlic, and set aside  
5. Cook the pasta until it is nearly done, drain and rinse to stop cooking  
6. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, melt 3 tbsp butter  
7. When it's foamy add flour and cook, stirring, until the mixture browns (about 5 mins)  
8. Remove bay leaves from milk and add, 1/4-cup at a time, into the flour mixture, stirring with  whisk constantly  
9. As soon as mixture becomes smooth, add more milk until the mixture is completely smooth  
10. Add the cheddar/gouda and stir  
11. Dump the pasta into a roasting pan and pour the cheese mix on top, top with parmesan and salt and pepper, stir  
12. Top with breadcrumbs and bake until bubbling, about 15 minutes  

## notes
* Optional: add smoked paprika at the end with the salt and pepper  
* As per the Amazing Ribs recipe, instead of baking in the oven, you can smoke the mac-n-cheese over 350º F, indirect heat for about 40 minutes (they also suggest mixing the panko with 3 tbsp melted butter!)
